# Spotify Enqueuer

This is a small app written in the meteor framework.  It was originally conceived as a simple way for an office to create a playlist for a communal sound source to play.  It interfaces with the spotify web API to get track information, and provides simple search functionality.

It was hacked into existence in about two days

I realise that it may look a lot like Soundrop.  The difference, I guess, is that this is something private that you can run on a local network, whereas Soundrop rooms are public.
